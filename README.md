# My <sup>solo <sup>100hrs</sup></sup> project


Going out to eat with friends is a great way to catch up and enjoy each other's company. But it can be a 
hassle to find a place that everyone likes. Dinder helps you find a place that everyone agrees on.
Like Tinder for food, use swipe matching to decide on the perfect place for your next meal.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, Postgres, Google Places API

This project was made using React and Next.js. I used Tailwind CSS for styling and Supabase for the Postgres database.
Prisma was used to generate the database models. The Google Places API was used to get the location & restaurant data.

## Optimizations

This project is still in progress. I plan to add a feature where you can filter restaurants by various criteria. I also plan to add a feature where you can see the restaurants on a map.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a great project to learn about React and how to use Next.js. I learned how to use Prisma to generate relational
database models, how to use the Google Places API to 
autocomplete location searches and fetch restaurant data. I also learned how to use Tailwind utility classes for
the
first time.
